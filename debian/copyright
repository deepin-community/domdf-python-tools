License: CC-BY-SA
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK
 OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
 THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
  a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
     anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
     unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
     assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
     defined below) for the purposes of this License.
  b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
     and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
     arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
     version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
     condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
     transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
     purpose of this License.
  c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work
     under the terms of this License.
  d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the
     Work.
  e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the
     terms of this License.
  f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
     with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
     from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
     previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or
 other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
 copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
  a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collective Works;
  b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
  c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective
     Works;
  d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission Derivative Works;
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
  a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License,
     and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
     for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
     distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the
     Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
     recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not
     sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
     this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
     distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
     control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the
     terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as
     incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
     Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to
     the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon
     notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
     remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
     the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,
     upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
     remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or
     the Original Author, as requested.
  b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this
     License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of each
     Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
     or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any
     terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of
     this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
     hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
     License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
     distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological
     measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
     inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
     applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective
     Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
     Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
     License.
  c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective
     Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
     give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means
     You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if
     applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
     Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
     identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
     "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be
     implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in
     the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such
     credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit
     appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other
     comparable authorship credit.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
  a. By offering the Work for public release under this License,
     Licensor represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's
     knowledge after reasonable inquiry:
       i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant
          the license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise
          of the rights granted hereunder without You having any
          obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees,
          residuals or any other payments;
      ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity
          rights, common law rights or any other right of any third
          party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other
          tortious injury to any third party.
  b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN
     WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN
     "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
     IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE
     CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY
 RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL
 LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
 THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED
 OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
     Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not
     have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
     entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1,
     2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
     is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
     release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
     terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
     force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
  a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or
     a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license
     to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
     to You under this License.
  b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
     Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.
  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
     understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
     Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
     additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
     You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
     agreement of the Licensor and You.

 whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
 incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
 license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
 Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
 shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
